<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>

<p><strong>Navigation Bar: </strong>The header will be a sticky nav bar banner going across the top of the page that
    contains links all of the different sections on the page.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome: </strong>An extremely brief three word introduction that states my name and the top three words that
    I used to describe myself. Under the words will be links to my GitHub handle, my LinkedIn profile, and a PDF of my
    resume.</p>

<p><strong>About Me: </strong>In this section, I will write a brief description of myself. The tone of voice will be
    personable and casual, as my goal is just to give readers a business-casual impression of who I am.</p>

<p><strong>Skills and Computer Proficiencies: </strong>This section will highlight my skills and computer proficiencies.
    I will include the following topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Programming Languages</li>
    <li>Front End</li>
    <li>Back End</li>
    <li>Databases</li>
    <li>Visualization/Animation/Design</li>
    <li>Design Frameworks</li>
    <li>Geolocation</li>
    <li>Project Management Collaboration Tools</li>
    <li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Virtualization</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Portfolio: </strong>This section will be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my
    best work for each category. Categories included are Front End, Full Stack, Android, iOS, and Animations. When the
    user clicks on a category, this section will display/change the gallery shown based on the category that was
    selected.</p>

<p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>This section will feature a fun fact about myself. I am building the world's largest jigsaw
    puzzle, and I will have a brief sentence about it under which is a carousel that contains 4 pictures of the puzzle.
</p>

<p><strong>Contact Me: </strong>This section will contain a simple contact form, with a spot for a sender to include
    his/her email address and a short message.</p>

<p><strong>Footer: </strong>The footer will be a banner going across the bottom of the page that contains links to my
    twitter and facebook accounts.</p>
