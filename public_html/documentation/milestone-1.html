    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <p><b>Name: </b>Greg Francis</p>
    <p><b>Age: </b>34</p>
    <br/>

    <p><b>Profession: </b>Greg is an associate professor at the University of New Mexico.  He is in his 7th year teaching, and is about to make full professor.  Greg is also the director of graduate admissions for the department of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

Also uses 11-inch iPad Pro with an M1 chip and Apple Pencil as a personal device and to teach.  Greg also has an iPhone 13 Pro and an Apple Watch, series 7.  Greg occasionally plays games on the XBox.</p>
    <p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors: </b>Greg is a busy professional.  He tries to balance work, community service, and his personal life.  Every early Spring, Greg looks at a stack of about 250 applications for graduate school.  He looks at the resumes on his screen and some of the resumes have links to portfolio pages like Cynthia Nikolai's.  He spends about 2 minutes scanning through individual's resumes and making notes on it.</p>
    <p><b>Frustrations and Needs: </b>Greg needs to select the top 30 applicants for next year's incoming graduate class.  Greg gets frustrated when applicants don't fill out all of the information they are supposed to and when links are broken on a resume or portfolio page.  Greg also gets frustrated by interruptions, and when students don't interact in his classes.  Greg also gets frustrated when students don't show that they are working hard in his classes.  Therefore, Greg is looking for talented, hard-working, high-achieving individuals to enter graduate school next year.</p>
    <p><b>Goals: </b>Greg is concerned about one thing: Is this person a good candidate for graduate school.  Can Greg review the application and resume and online portfolio in 7 minutes and determine if this person is a good candidate.  If the person is a good candidate, then Greg will place the candidate in the potential accept pile for further review by the graduate committee.</p>
    <p><b>User Story: </b>As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for admission into graduate school or collaboration on research.</p>
